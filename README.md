Image Processing - Histogram

This is my assignment for the course of Image Processing at the National University of Malaysia (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia) in 2010.
This software does simple image processing functions on image histogram:
- Gaussian Distribution Based on Sigma
- Exponential Shape Based on Landa
- Histogram Equalization

In addition, it also draws the histogram of the orginal and resulted photos.
